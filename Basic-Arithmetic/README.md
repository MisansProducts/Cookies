# Cookies/Basic-Arithmetic

This assembly program is a cheatsheet for arithmetic operations when dealing with data of the byte, word, double word, and quad word sizes.

I have not found a reliable way to run this program.

Future updates will include:
* Instructions on how to run the program
* Output to the terminal to display the operations and answers
