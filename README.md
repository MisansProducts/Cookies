# Cookies

Cookies is an umbrella repository for smaller projects that I do not plan to update frequently. Each subfolder used to be its own repository on GitHub, but I consolidated them into this one repository here.

## Projects

- [📁 **Useful Notes**](/1-useful-notes/) – My personal notes for the C++ language.
