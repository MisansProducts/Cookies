# Cookies

Cookies is an umbrella repository for smaller projects that I do not plan to update frequently. Each subfolder used to be its own repository on GitHub, but I consolidated them into this one repository here.

## Projects

- [📁 **Basic Arithmetic**](/Basic-Arithmetic/) – Cheatsheet for using arithmetic operations in Assembly language.
- [📁 **Lexical Links**](/Lexical-Links/) – A word association game in JavaScript language.
- [📁 **Sequential Sum**](/Sequential-Sum/) – Demonstrates run time complexity in Python language.
- [📁 **Swanky Rebels**](/Swanky-Rebels/) – Text adventure game in Batch language.
- [📁 **Useful Notes**](/Useful-Notes/) – My personal notes for the C++ language.
