# Cookies/~Main

This is my first Python project. It consists of a variety of functions that each do different things. To use it, run `main.py` and use one of the functions below.

Functions:
* `myFunc(degree, t, value)` - A relatively new function that calculates the displacement of some object over an initial exponent of velocity.
* `multP(num, count = 0)` - Calculates the multiplicative persistence of a number. This means for a given number, multiply their digits together and get a new number. Do this until you have a one-digit number or 0.
* `cool_stars(d)` - Generates a pattern of stars.
* `add(n)` - Adds a list of numbers together.
* `multiply(n)` - Multiplies a list of numbers together.
* `find_time()` - Calculates the time on a clock from the given time and the time elapsed.
* `b_sort()` - Bubble sort a list of numbers.
* `bSortNew(amount = 10, min = 0, max = 10)` - Bubble sort a random list of numbers.
* `s_sort()` - Selection sort a list of numbers.
* `i_sort()` - Insertion sort a list of numbers.
* `max_matrix_indicies()` - Finds the coordinates of the largest number in a matrix.
* `d_dict()` - Reverses keys and values in a dictionary data type.
* `proj_1()` - Gets quotient and remainder.
* `proj_2()` - Gets elapsed time.
* `proj_3()` - Unfinished.
* `rand_grid()` - Produces a grid of random letters.
